# Evaluation of methods for AI-enabled material property predictions
This work aims to evaluate methods for modelling and predicting building material information, including accounting for incomplete data.

## Neuro-symbolic AI
Neuro-symbolic AI methods that deal with working with different data sourses, modelling and predicting material property data, and validating the results. The aim is to find a symbiosis of data-driven (sub-symbolic) and knowledge-driven (symbolic) approaches in both modelling and predicting building material information.

## Evaluation of Methods
This work aims to evaluate methods for modelling and predicting building material information, including accounting for incomplete data.

The methods examined, as shown in the table below, address data modeling techniques such as missing value imputation, natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and ontology developments. Methods for data prediction and population assessment include machine learning and artificial neural networks, as well as knowledge graph inference techniques.

## Experiment and implementaiton of an instance

Further, an early-stage experiments is tested aganist two uses cases addressing symbolic methods to analyse semtnics and cappture domain knowledge and sub-symbolic methods, to predict material properties. Use Case 1, tackles the modelling and prediction of physical material property prediction, and Use Case 2, addresses the modelling and prediction of environmental indicators.
