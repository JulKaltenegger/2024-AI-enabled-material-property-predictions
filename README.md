# Evaluation of methods for AI-enabled material property predictions
This work aims to evaluate methods for modelling and predicting building material information, including accounting for incomplete data.

## Neuro-symbolic AI
Neuro-symbolic AI methods that deal with working with different data sources, modelling and predicting material property data, and validating the results. The aim is to find a symbiosis of data-driven (sub-symbolic) and knowledge-driven (symbolic) approaches in both modelling and predicting building material information.

## Evaluation of Methods
This work aims to evaluate methods for modelling and predicting building material information, including accounting for incomplete data.
The methods examined, as shown in the table below, address data modelling techniques such as missing value imputation, natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and ontology developments. Methods for data prediction and population assessment include machine learning and artificial neural networks, as well as knowledge graph inference techniques. Find references in the 'LiteratureList.xlsx'.

| Method | Data Source | Data modelling | Data prediction and population | Data validation and storage |
| :-----------------: | :----------: | :----------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Techniques| Extract Transform Load | Semantic analysis and concept definition | Data-driven and logic approach | Exploration |
| Sub-Symbolic | Feature engineering, Imputation and Missing Values | Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) | Model Evaluation |
| Symbolic | Knowledge Engineering and Ontology | Semantic Knowledge Graph | Knowlegde Graph inference, Link prediction, Description Logic | Resolution-based reasoning |

## Experiment and implementaiton of an instance
An early-stage experiments is tested against two uses cases addressing symbolic methods to analyse semantics and capture domain knowledge and sub-symbolic methods, to predict material properties, see figure below. Further, two use cases are explored. Use Case 1, tackles the modelling and prediction of physical material property prediction, and Use Case 2, addresses the modelling and prediction of environmental indicators.
