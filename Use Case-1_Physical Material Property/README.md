#  Use Case 1 - Prediction of Material Physical Property 
Use Case Specification: This use case specifies on the semantic definition, modelling, and prediction of materials physical properties.

Data Source: 2021 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals covers basic principles and data used in the HVAC&R industry. It covers thermodynamics, psychrometrics, and heat transfer, and provide practical guidance on building envelope, indoor environmental quality, load calculations, duct and piping system design, refrigerants, energy resources, sustainability, a new chapter on climate change, and more. In particular it contains material physical properties, including material density (ρ) (kg/m3), conductivity (λ) (W/m⋅K), and specific heat capacity (⁠J/kg⋅K).

(a) inputs (Xn) are the independent variables (material name, material conductivity, material specific heat capacity)
(b) outputs (Yn) is the dependent variables (material density)

ML-driven approaches in the field of materials science, focusing on the design and optimization of specific materials for build- ings or structures.
